# CISM Domain 2 – Information Risk Management & Compliance (20%)

## Purpose of the Domain

Information Risk Management and Compliance ensures that organizational risks to information assets are identified, assessed, treated, monitored, and communicated in line with business objectives and regulatory obligations.

This domain focuses on creating a **repeatable, measurable risk management process** that enables leadership to:
- Understand exposure to cyber risk
- Make informed risk-based decisions
- Maintain compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations
- Support business continuity and resilience

Effective risk management balances **security controls with business enablement** rather than security for its own sake.

---

## Core Objectives

Domain 2 ensures organizations:

- Identify and assess information risks consistently
- Apply appropriate controls based on risk appetite
- Monitor and communicate risk exposure
- Meet compliance obligations
- Maintain awareness across the enterprise

---

## Risk Management Principles

### Risk-Based Approach

Security decisions must be guided by **risk**, not assumptions or technology trends.  
The risk approach consists of evaluating:

**Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**

- **Threat:** Source of potential harm (cyber criminals, insider threats, natural hazards)
- **Vulnerability:** Weakness that could be exploited
- **Impact:** Business harm if the event occurs

---

### Common Risk Management Frameworks

Domain 2 aligns heavily with internationally recognized frameworks:

| Framework | Primary Focus |
|----------|----------------|
| **ISO 27005** | Information security risk management methodology |
| **NIST RMF** | Risk lifecycle tied to system authorization |
| **COSO ERM** | Enterprise-wide risk governance |
| **ISO 31000** | Generic risk management principles |

**CISM Perspective:**  
Risk management must integrate with **enterprise governance**, not operate as a siloed IT activity.

---

---

## Risk Management Lifecycle

Risk management follows a continuous cycle:

1. **Risk Identification**
2. **Risk Assessment**
3. **Risk Treatment**
4. **Risk Monitoring & Reporting**
5. **Continuous Improvement**

---

### Risk Identification

Identifies threats to critical business processes and information assets.

**Inputs:**
- Asset inventories
- Threat intelligence
- Audit findings
- Regulatory requirements
- Incident trends

---

### Risk Assessment

Risk is evaluated using:

#### 1. Likelihood
- High / Medium / Low
- Frequency of threat materialization
- Existing control effectiveness

#### 2. Impact
- Financial loss
- Regulatory penalties
- Operational disruption
- Reputational damage
- Loss of life or safety

**Risk Ratings**
- Qualitative scales (H/M/L)
- Quantitative analysis (financial modeling)
- Semi-quantitative scoring matrices

---

### Inherent vs Residual Risk

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Inherent Risk** | Risk before any controls |
| **Residual Risk** | Risk after controls are applied |

Management decisions are based on **residual risk relative to risk appetite**.

---

---

## Asset Classification and Valuation

Assets must be classified to ensure risk resources are prioritized correctly.

### Asset Types

- Information data
- Systems and infrastructure
- Personnel
- Facilities
- Operational services

---

### Classification Criteria

Classification should consider:

- **Confidentiality**
- **Integrity**
- **Availability**
- **Legal sensitivity**
- **Commercial value**
- **Reputational importance**

---

### Example Asset Classification Model

| Level | Description |
|------|---------------|
| **Public** | No harm if disclosed (marketing materials) |
| **Internal** | Limited internal harm |
| **Confidential** | Business impact if exposed |
| **Restricted** | Severe regulatory or financial harm |

---

---

## Security Control Baselines

Control baselines define a **minimum set of safeguards** applied to assets based on classification level and risk profile.

---

### Control Frameworks

CISM supports controls from major frameworks:

| Framework | Application |
|-----------|----------------|
| ISO 27001 Annex A | Information security controls |
| NIST SP 800-53 | Government/compliance environments |
| CIS Controls | Practical operational security |

---

### Types of Controls

| Control Type | Purpose |
|---------------|----------|
| **Preventive** | Stop incidents |
| **Detective** | Identify incidents |
| **Corrective** | Restore systems |
| **Compensating** | Alternative safeguards |

---

---

## Risk Treatment Options

Management selects treatments that align with business priorities:

| Treatment | Description |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Avoid** | Eliminate risky activity |
| **Mitigate** | Apply security controls |
| **Transfer** | Insurance or third-party contracts |
| **Accept** | Formally acknowledge risk |

Risk acceptance must be:
- Documented
- Approved by leadership
- Reviewed periodically

---

---

## Risk Monitoring & Reporting

Risk management is **not a one-time exercise**.

### Monitoring Methods

- Continuous control monitoring
- Periodic audits
- Risk reassessments
- Incident trend reporting
- Regulatory compliance reviews

---

### Governance Reporting

Key metrics reported to leadership:

- Top enterprise risks
- Control effectiveness
- Compliance gaps
- Incident statistics
- Risk trend indicators

---

---

## Compliance Management

Regulatory frameworks shape control requirements:

### Common Compliance Domains

- Data protection (UK GDPR)
- Financial regulations
- Healthcare and operational compliance
- Critical national infrastructure protections

---

### Compliance Activities

- Compliance gap assessments
- Control mapping to regulations
- Policy management
- Audit support
- Regulatory reporting

CISM stresses that:
> **Compliance supports security — but compliance alone does not ensure security.**

---

---

## Security Awareness & Documentation

### Awareness Training

Programs must be:

- Role-based
- Risk-focused
- Continuous

Training topics include:
- Data protection
- Phishing
- Reporting incidents
- Policy adherence

---

### Required Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|---------|------------|
| Risk management policy | Defines governance of cyber risk |
| Risk register | Tracks enterprise risks |
| Asset classification policy | Improves data handling |
| Compliance procedures | Supports audits |
| Awareness materials | Strengthens culture |

---

---
