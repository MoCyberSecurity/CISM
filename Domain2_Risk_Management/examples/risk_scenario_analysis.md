**Scenario:** Payment system vulnerability could lead to $3M loss.

- Appetite: $2M → cannot accept
- Tolerance: ±$250K → exceeds tolerance → mitigate
- Capacity: $10M → still survivable

**Action:** Apply mitigation controls immediately.

**Key Takeaway:** Scenario analysis applies boundaries to real-world decisions.
