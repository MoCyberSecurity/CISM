# Domain 3: Information Security Program Development and Management

✅ **Main Focus**  
Domain 3 accounts for **33% of the CISM exam** and covers:  

- Information Security Program Development  
- Information Security Program Management  

---

## 1. Purpose of an Information Security Program

An information security program ensures that security is **managed consistently and strategically across the organization**. It requires executive support and alignment with business goals, risk tolerance, and organizational culture. Without a program, security efforts can become fragmented and ineffective.

---

## 2. Program Charter

The **Program Charter** is the foundational document that gives the security program authority. It defines objectives, timelines, funding, and leadership roles. Approval by executive leadership ensures that security initiatives have the necessary backing to develop policies, manage risks, implement controls, respond to incidents, and support business continuity.

---

## 3. Scope of the Program

Defining the **scope** clarifies what departments, units, affiliates, and systems are covered under the security program. This prevents gaps in governance and ensures that resources are focused on the most critical areas.

---

## 4. Core Components

A security program integrates three main components:  

1. **Processes:** Such as risk management, compliance, architecture, and operations.  
2. **Technologies:** Security tools like firewalls, IDS/IPS, DLP, anti-malware, and GRC platforms.  
3. **Assets:** All critical organizational assets, including hardware, software, data, facilities, and personnel.  

Together, these components create a structured and cohesive security program.

---

## 5. Information & System Classification

Classifying information and systems helps determine **protection priorities**. Classification is based on value, criticality, integrity, sensitivity, and potential impact on reputation. Common levels include Secret, Restricted, Confidential, and Public. Classification guides policies, system hardening, and controls for each asset type.

---

## 6. Frameworks & Standards

Security programs leverage **industry frameworks** for guidance:  

- **Control Frameworks:** ISO 27002, NIST SP 800-53, CIS CSC  
- **Risk Management Frameworks:** ISO 31000, NIST CSF  
- **Program Management Frameworks:** ISO 27001, ETSI TR 103787  

These frameworks help ensure consistency, regulatory compliance, and best practices.

---

## 7. Policy Development

Policies provide **rules and expectations** for managing security risks. Effective policies align with laws, regulations, risk tolerance, and organizational culture, and must be clear, accessible, and actionable for all employees.

---

## 8. Security Metrics

Metrics measure the effectiveness of the security program:  

- **KRIs (Key Risk Indicators):** Track emerging risks  
- **KGIs (Key Goal Indicators):** Monitor achievement of security goals  
- **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):** Evaluate control performance  

Metrics should be **SMART**—Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely—to guide improvements.

---

## 9. Controls

Controls are **mechanisms to reduce risk**:  

- **Types:** Physical, Technical, Administrative  
- **Classes:** Preventive, Detective, Deterrent, Corrective, Compensating, Recovery  
- **Lifecycle:** Design → Test → Implement → Monitor → Audit  

Controls ensure that risks are managed effectively across the organization.

---

## 10. Operational Activities

These are day-to-day activities that maintain security posture:  

- Event monitoring, log reviews, SIEM, threat intelligence, SOAR  
- Vulnerability and patch management  
- Endpoint protection, anti-malware, EDR/XDR  
- Identity & Access Management (IAM), MFA, passwordless authentication  
- Access governance, segregation of duties, and access reviews  

They ensure **continuous protection and rapid response** to threats.

---

## 11. Data Governance

Data governance defines **how data is protected and managed**:  

- Backup & recovery strategies  
- Data classification policies  
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems  
- Digital Rights Management (DRM)  

Effective data governance minimises risks from loss, leakage, or misuse of critical information.
