# Control Implementation Example

**Scenario:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all corporate systems.

**Steps:**
1. Identify all systems and user groups
2. Configure MFA using existing IAM platform
3. Test deployment with pilot group
4. Roll out organization-wide
5. Monitor adoption and report exceptions

**Notes:** Controls should follow lifecycle: Design → Test → Implement → Monitor → Audit
